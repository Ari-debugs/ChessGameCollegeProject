# Chess Game in Java

## Project Overview
This project is a web-based **Chess Game** implemented in Java with a front end built using **JAVA**. The backend handles game logic and rules, while the front end provides an interactive chessboard interface for players. It demonstrates the integration of Java with web technologies to create a real-time, browser-based game experience.

## Features
- **Standard Chess Rules**: Supports all standard moves, including castling, en passant(in passing), and pawn promotion.
- **Responsive Chessboard**: The chessboard and pieces are styled for easy interaction using Java.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Player moves are sent to the Java backend, which validates and updates the board state.
- **Turn-Based Gameplay**: The game enforces turn-based rules, highlights possible moves, and indicates game state changes such as check and checkmate.
